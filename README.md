# Predict-flight-delays-by-creating-a-machine-learning-model-in-Python
Import airline arrival data into a Jupyter notebook and use Pandas to clean it. Then, build a machine learning model with Scikit-Learn and use Matplotlib to visualize output.

In this module, you will:

Create an Azure Notebook and import flight data
Use Pandas to clean and prepare data
Use Scikit-learn to build a machine-learning model
Use Matplotlib to visualize the output
